# script

That is the last example I have to show-- I hope you've learned something and also can take away that, it's rather easy
to achieve a lot in this area with small go scripts.

Some final notes on this content: 

1. I learned this and more from a series of weekends hacking away at audio devices-- if you do the same, 
   take your headphones off before running new code; I have omitted many failed experiments that just led to
   high pitch noise.

2. I am not an audio engineer by trade, so if you're taking this knowledge into a high value scenario I encourage you
   to research, verify, and test thoroughly.

3. There is a lot of complexity lying between this code and the speaker, depending on your operating system. This would
   take a lot longer to explain, but it is open source for perusal.

4. What we've coded and demoed here reflects just western music standards; all the pitches, intervals, chords and keys
   are meaningful only in that context. There are other ways to think about music that aren't reflected here which I
   encourage you to explore.
